  <h1>pwgen -- a password/passphrase generator</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  <p><a href="index.cgi">This page</a> will generate for you -- just you! --
  a unique, artisanal, hand-crafted passphrase.  By default, the passphrase
  will consist of 4 english words, hopefully allowing you to be able to
  memorize it while at the same time providing sufficient entropy to make
  it reasonably secure.</P>
  <p>You may be familiar with this concept from <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">this
  xkcd comic</a>.</p>
  <h2>I don't like the HTML.</h2>
  <p>Yeah, I know.  I don't even CSS, really.</p>
  <p>If you want just your unique, artisanal, hand-crafted passphrase
  <a href="index.cgi?nohtml=1">pass nohtml=1</a> in your request.</p>
  <h2>So these are good passwords, then?</h2>
  <p>
  Not necessarily.  They are generated on a VM using the
  operating system's PRNG which was seeded in who knows what manner.  The
  wordlists contains 5K words each, but if the attacker knew that you're
  generating exactly four words and they know your acrostic word (if any),
  then this wouldn't be a very strong password.
  </p>
  <p>
  <em>However</em>, these passphrases might still be better than any
  passphrase you come up with yourself, because unfortunately humans
  are rather predictable and would generate low-entropy passphrases
  even using this schema.
  </p>
  <p>
  In the end, you shouldn't even need this generator at all.  Use a
  password manager, like <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a>,
  <a href="https://lastpass.com/">lastpass</a>, <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/">Dashlane</a>,
  or something like that.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>The best password is one that you don't even know.</b>
  </p>
  <h2>How was this implemented?</h2>
  <p>This site uses the <a href="https://github.com/redacted/XKCD-password-generator">XKCD-password-generator</a>
  for generation of xkcd style passphrases.</p>
  <p>For the generation of complex passwords, it basically runs:
<blockquote><pre><tt>tr -dc 'A-Za-z0-9`~!@#$%^&amp;*()_+[]{}\|;:?,./' &lt; /dev/urandom \
        | head -c ${num} | xargs</tt></pre></blockquote>
  <p>The code for this site is available on Git in
